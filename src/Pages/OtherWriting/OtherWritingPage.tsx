                <p>The man desperately hides his own bare form.</p>
                <p>He hides and he cloaks and he buries.</p>

                <p>“Will you spare me?” he said, holding the wax within his hands. “When you spread your light and swallow up the world?”</p>
                <p>The candle spoke, and with its word it summoned the strength to leap free and to the cloth that burned so bright.</p>
                <p>“No.”</p>

                <h2>The Falling Embers</h2>
                <p>An ongoing work of my first full novel. </p>
                <p>In the wake of a long war, a peace forged by the rule of powerful religious leaders rests on dry tinder. A rot has set root in the orders, one that seeks to seize the power of a long-dead race, whatever the cost.</p>
                <p>Thrown into the storm of a furious past clashing brought to the present two young natives of the capital are forced to flee into the wilds. What they'll find will reveal the real depths of the ambitions of those willing to tear down an Empire, and the existential stakes facing them all.</p>
