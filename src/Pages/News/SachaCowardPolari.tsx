        I am one of the 16 (updated) authors who chose to leave the Polari
        Prize, and I find myself frustrated and saddened at the way this entire
        story has been represented.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an article about authors opting out of a literary prize, you have
        included a statement from only one of those authors. On the other hand,
        you have chosen to include the words of two other major gender critical
        voices, neither of whom were in any way affiliated with the prize.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be clear, the decision to leave was not orchestrated, it was organic.
        Nobody contacted me to tell me to leave. Each of the 14 writers chose to
        leave, because of their own sense of integrity as to what the Polari
        Prize claimed to stand for.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was an LGBTQ+ award, which included transgender, nonbinary and
        intersex authors. That was the purpose of the award. Our issue was not
        with Boyne as a person, but with his statements about transgender people
        and those who support them
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, Boyne wrote that those women who supported transgender women
        were akin to people willing to ‘pin a handmaiden down as her husband
        rapes her’.
      </p>
      <p>
        For context, this is taken from Margaret Atwood’s ‘A Handmaid’s Tale’,
        wherein women are forcibly abused and assaulted.
      </p>
      <p>
        How else can this statement be interpreted other than stating that
        transgender women are a hostile force, and that all women who support
        them are complicit in their own abuse?
      </p>
      <p>
        In turn, all of us have been called ‘The Gender Taliban’ compared to the
        Nazis and the Stazi. Accused of censorship, bullying and trying to get
        another author to end his life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been accused of being a child abuser, called every homophobic
        slur you can imagine.
      </p>
      <p>We left a literary award.</p>
      <p>
        In the articles I have read in the mainstream press Jon Boyne has been
        giving space to share his feelings, his human response to this, which is
        exactly as it should be.
      </p>
      <p>But the 16 authors, and one judge are not afforded the same space.</p>
      <p>
        Each has expressed heartbreak over turning down something that was
        supposed to be a source of joy, each has expressed frustration and
        disappointment, and each has been called every name under the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        For my part I wish John Boyne no pain, I did not leave the award to hurt
        him, to make him suffer. I do not know him.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m certain the past few days have been awful for him, they’ve not been
        great for me either.
      </p>
      <p>
        Irrespective of how John feels, his words are simply not compatible with
        an inclusive prize that celebrates all LGBTQ+ people. Just like a racist
        statement would not be allowed in a prize for writers of colour, or a
        sexist statement tolerated for a prize for feminist writers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing about this is pleasant, nobody is enjoying this or doing it for
        ‘woke points’. People have principles by which they stand, and 14 of us
        have decided that these no longer align with the Polari Prize. I stand
        by my decision, and every author that was called to make a similar
        choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, far from least, the transgender people in this country who have
        been made to feel monstrous and inhuman by a constant barrage of
        misinformation and slander. How do they feel?
      </p>
      <p>
        It is awful that anyone feels broken by this situation, but is there
        space for their feelings?
      </p>

      <p>I fear not.</p>
